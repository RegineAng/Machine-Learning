# Machine-Learning
Code for machine learning
//below are the codes i used for my machine learning project using phyton. 
In the course of my project, i did Principal component analysis (PCA) and clustering methods to summarize information given on the data to plot tables. 
such as( K-Means, Hierarchical Agglomerative Clustering, DBScan)
Supervised regression such as (linear regression,regularised regressions and stepwise regression) were used.
Different models for supervised classification (logistic regression, KNN, Support vector classifier(SVC), Decision tree models)
